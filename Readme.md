# Git & Github Information  
## Git:-
git is Version Control System (VCS).

git was created by Linus Torvalds in the year of 2005.

git is free & open source & scalable & super fast & efficient.

## Version Control System:-
It is a system that keeps track of our files, tracking any changes in our code, manage versions & their rollback (means anytime you can revert the previous version).

It allows us collaboration among multiple developers.

### Types of Version Control System:-
1. Centralized Version Control System :-
    - ex:- svn 
    - limited offline support requires a connection to commit, require server access for collaboration 
    - Stores full file copies 
    - Slower depends on server & Larger Repository Size

1. Distributed Version Control System:- 
    - ex:- git, mercurial
    - gives offline support, easily collaboration among multiple devlopers
    - Stores differences
    - Faster & Smaller Repository Size
